### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matan - a Software Engineer in the making, with a passion for all things code!! 

I'm currently studying at the University of Auckland, where I'm completeing my Bachelor of Software Engineering (Hons). 

In here you'll find projects I have worked on over the past few years!

As an upcoming Software Engineer, I am always looking for ways to improve - so any feedback is much appreciated!
